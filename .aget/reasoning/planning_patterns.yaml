planning:
  approach: iterative
  style: incremental_delivery

  patterns:
    feature_development:
      steps:
        - Understand requirements
        - Design approach
        - Implement incrementally
        - Test continuously
        - Refactor for quality
        - Document changes
      governance: L42 (gate boundaries)

    bug_fixing:
      steps:
        - Reproduce issue
        - Isolate root cause
        - Design fix
        - Implement and test
        - Verify fix
        - Prevent regression
      governance: evidence-first (L289)

    refactoring:
      steps:

        - Make incremental changes
        - Verify behavior preserved
        - Update documentation
      governance: minimal_change

  verification:
    required:
      - Unit tests pass
      - Integration tests pass
      - Code review complete
    recommended:
